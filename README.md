# Definition
-	Scrum is a lightweight Framework.
-	It’s helps to generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
-	A Scrum Master is required to foster an environment where:
- A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
  - The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint. 
  - The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint. 
  - REPEAT
-	Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.
-	Purposefully incomplete, only defining requirements to implement Scrum theory.
-	Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the Framework.
-	Makes visible the effectiveness of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.

****

# Scrum Theory
-	Founded on empiricism and lean thinking.
     -	Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
     -	Lead thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essential.
-	Incremental approach:
     -	to optimise predictability
     -	Control Risk
-	Scrum engages groups with the required expertise and skills and share and acquire skills as needed.
-	Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a Sprint,
-	These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of
     -	Transparency
          - Emergent Process and work must be visible to all.
          -	Low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
          -	Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.
     - Inspection
        -	Detects potentially undesirable variances or problems.
       -	Inspection enables adaptation and is pointless if adaptation doesn’t occur.
       -	Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

     - Adaption
          -	Adjustments must be made to minimise deviations.
          -	The team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything through inspection.
          -	The team is self-managed.

# Scrum Values

People must become proficient in the following values:
1.	**Commitment**

      a.	To achieving Goals.

      b.	Supporting Each other.

2.	**Focus** 

      a.	On the work of the current sprint.

3.	**Openness**

      a.	About the work and it’s challenges (during daily stand-ups)

4.	**Respect**

      a.	Each other to be capable, independent people.
      b.	Individuals are respected in return.

5.	Courage
      a.	To do the right thing and work on tough problems.

-	These values give direction.
-	Decisions are made and steps are taken.


>‘When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.’

****

# Scrum Team

-	A small and cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
-	Cross functional:
-	The members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint.
-	Self-Managing:
  -	Divide tasks amongst themselves.
  - Who, does what, when. 
  - Responsible for all product related activities. 
  - 10 or fewer members on a team 

**Teams include:** 

**8 or fewer Developers** who:

****

# Scrum Events
-	The sprint is the container for all other events.
-	Formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.
-	Enable transparency.
-	Create regularity and minimise need for meetings.
-	Held at the same time and place.

****

# The Sprint
-	Heartbeat of Scrum.
-	Fixed length events for consistency - 1 month or less.
-	A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous.
-	Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.
-	All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal happen within Sprints:
-	Including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
-	Enables predictability via Inspection and adaption at least every calendar month.
-	Each sprint may be considered a small project.
-	A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.
-	Only the **Product Owner** has the authority to cancel the Sprint.

During the sprint:
-	No changes are made.
-   Quality does not decrease.
-	Product Backlog is refined as needed.
-	Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner.

****

# Sprint Planning
-	Lays out the work to be performed collaboratively between the scrum team.
-	Product Owner ensures team is prepared to discuss the most important Backlog items.
-	Scrum Team may also invite others to provide advice.
-	The following topics are addressed:
     o	Why is this Sprint valuable?
     	Product Owner proposes how the product could increase value.
     	Team then defines a Sprint Goal.
     o	What can be done in this Sprint?
     	Items selected collaboratively from the Product Backlog.
     o	How will the chosen work get done?
     	Devs plan the necessary work to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done.
-	All three Topics combined create the Sprint Backlog.
-	Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.
     o	Can be shorter for shorter sprints.

****

# Daily Scrum
-	To inspect progress and make necessary adjustments towards obtaining the Sprint Goal.
-	15 minutes event.
-	Held at the same time and place daily.
-	Produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
     o	Improves Focus and Self-management.

****

# Sprint Review
-	Inspect outcomes of the Sprint and determine future adaptions.
-	Display results to Stakeholders.
-	Discuss progress toward Product Goal.
-	Attendees collaborate on what to do next.
-	Product Backlog may be adjusted to meet new opportunities.
-	Working Session:
     o	Avoid limiting it to a presentation.
-	Second to last event:
     o	Maximum of 4 hours once per month.

****

# Sprint Retrospective
-	Sprint Conclusion, maximum 3 hours in length.
-	An Inspection on how the last Sprint went.

**Inspection of:** 
-	Individuals
-	Interactions
-	Processes
-	Tools
-	Definition of Done
-	Assumptions that led them astray are identified and origins explored.

**Discussion topics:**
- What went well?
-	What didn’t? What could be improved?
-	How were the problems were (or were not) solved?
-	What are the actions going forward?

**The Purpose is to:**
-	Identify most helpful changes and plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
-	Identify possible tools to use: Emotional Seismograph, a visual on the team members feelings throughout the process.

****

# Scrum Artifacts
-	Designed for transparency of key info.
  -	Each artifact contains a **commitment** to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus 
  against which progress can be measured:

       _For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
     
       For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
     
       For the Increment it is the Definition of Done._

****

# Product Backlog:
-	List of what is needed to improve the product.
-	Single source of undertaken work by the Scrum Team.
-	Product Backlog items that can be completed are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event.
-	Product Backlog refinement breaks the Product Backlog down further into smaller precise items.

****

# Product Goal:
-	Describes a future state of the project that can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to play against.
-	Long Term Objective.

****

# Sprint Backlog:

The Sprint Goal - **Why?**
- Single objective of the Sprint.
- Created coherence and focus.
- Encourages Teamwork.
- Created during Sprint Planning.
- By and for the developers

The set of backlog items selected for the Sprint - **What?**

An actionable plan for delivering the Increment/Sprint - **How?**

The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. 
It contains enough detail to inspect progress in the Daily Scrum.

****

# Increment:
-	A concrete step toward the Product Goal.
-	Each increment is additive to the previous increment and all increments must work together.
-	To provide value, it must be usable.
-	Multiple increments may be created in a sprint.
-	The sum of increments is presented in the Sprint Review.
-	Must meet the Definition of Done.

****

# Definition of Done:
-	Formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required.
     o	Completed? Has bugs/requires fixes?
-	Once Product Backlog item meets Definition of Done, an Increment is born.
-	Creates Transparency:
     o	Shared understanding of work completed as part of the Increment.
-	If Definition of Done not met, item is not released or presented in Sprint Review.
     o	Returns to Product Backlog for future consideration.
-	If multiple Scrum Teams, they must all mutually agree on the Definition of Done.
